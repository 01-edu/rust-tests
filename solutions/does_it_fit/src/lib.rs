### Instructions

Using the `areas_volumes` module provided, create two functions:

- `area_fit` that receives 6 arguments:
  - `x` and `y`, size of the square in which it is going to be tried to fit the geometrical shapes (both usize)
  - `objects`, the type of geometrical shape(s) that it is  going to be tried to be fitted in the square (areas_volumes::GeometricalShapes)
  - `times`, the number of geometrical shapes that are going to be tried to be fitted in the square (usize)
  - `a` and `b`, the dimensions that the plane(s) shape(s) passed will have (both usize)
    - `a` will refer to the side of the Square, the radius of the Circle, the side_a of the Rectangle or the base of the Triangle
    - `b` will refer to the side_b of the Rectangle or the height of the Triangle

- `area_fit` should return if the geometrical shape(s) fit inside of the square.
    - `volume_fit` that receives 8 arguments:
  - `x`, `y` and `z`, size of the box in which it is going to be tried to fit the geometrical volumes (both usize)
  - `objects`, the type of geometrical volume(s) that it is  going to be tried to be fitted in the box (areas_volumes::GeometricalVolumes)
  - `times`, the number of geometrical volumes that are going to be tried to be fitted in the box (usize)
  - `a`, `b` and `c`, the dimensions that the geometrical volume(s) passed will have (all of them usize)
    - `a` will refer to the side of the Cube, the radius of the Sphere, the side_a of the Parallelepiped, the area of the base of the Triangular Pyramid or the base radius of the Cone
    - `b` will refer to the side_b of the Parallelepiped, the height of the Triangular Pyramid or the height of the Cone
    - `c` will refer to the side_c of the Parallelepiped
- `volume_fit` should return if the geometrical volume(s) fit inside of the box.

### Expected Functions (and Structures)

```rs
pub fn area_fit(
    x: usize,
    y: usize,
    objects: areas_volumes::GeometricalShapes,
    times: usize,
    a: usize,
    b: usize,
) {}
pub fn volume_fit(
    x: usize,
    y: usize,
    z: usize,
    objects: areas_volumes::GeometricalVolumes,
    times: usize,
    a: usize,
    b: usize,
    c: usize,
) {}
```
### Usage

Here is a program to test your function:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(
        "Does 100 rectangles (2x1) fit in a 2 by 4 square? {}",
        area_fit(2, 4, GeometricalShapes::Rectangle, 100, 2, 1)
    );
    println!(
        "Does 3 triangles (5 base and 3 height) fit in a 5 by 5 square? {}",
        area_fit(5, 5, GeometricalShapes::Triangle, 3, 5, 3)
    );
    println!(
        "Does 3 spheres (2 radius) fit in a 5 by 5 by 5 box? {}",
        volume_fit(5, 5, 5, GeometricalVolumes::Sphere, 3, 2, 0, 0)
    );
    println!(
        "Does 3 triangles (5 base and 3 height) fit in a 5 by 7 by 5 box? {}",
        volume_fit(5, 7, 5, GeometricalVolumes::Parallelepiped, 1, 6, 7, 4)
    );
}
```

And its output:

```sh
$ cargo run
false
true
false
true
$
```
